The speciality drug cost for pembrolizumab can be $100,000 annually, and the Alternative Drug is $50,000 annually. 

This generates a price difference of $50,000 annually, which needs to be used in the ROI calculation. 

Say 100 patients taking the speciality drug pembrolizumab in the health plan, and 10% of them enrol in the IVPE trial (10 patients). 

During the trial, we would charge, say 80% of the annual cost of pembrolizumab (delete next field, for the enrollment rate because already inputted that). 

Then on the results page, guaranteed cost-savings during the trial (assuming trial duration of 12 months) would be 20% of $100,000 x the number of patients in the trial (i.e. $20k x 10 or $200k). 
The amount paid to PGP would be 80% of $100k x 10 or $800k. 
So the ROI during trial would be 25% or 1.25 (= $200,000 ÷ $800,000 = 0.25 → 25% You can also express it as a benefit-cost ratio: $1,000,000 ÷ $800,000 = 1.25 (the plan avoids $1.25 of baseline cost for every $1 paid to PGP).
So on the results page to the right, we should put total cost-savings from avoided utilization $200k and ROI of 1.25x

Then for calculating ROI for post-trial adoption - if we set the slider at 70% this means that 70 patients from the 100 patients will take the low cost drug ($50k p/a), which generates cost savings of $3.5m (70 x $50k), so with the cost of the the trial being $800k ($80k x 10) this creates an ROI of 
= $3,500,000 ÷ $800,000
= 4.375 → 438%

This is for 1 year and perhaps we can change adoption each year to calculate the cost-savings each year or extrapolate it by adding $3.5 cost-savings each year from 70 patients taking 50% dose and savings $50k.

assume 1 year for the trial and estimate the cost-savings next year and can think about how to do the future projections separately
